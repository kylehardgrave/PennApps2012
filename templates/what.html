            <h3>The premiere hackathon</h3>
            <p>A hackathon is when people who are excited about programming come together for a weekend and collaborate to build cool things. Entrepreneurs, designers, and developers work in teams to create hacks and apps for web or mobile platforms - in our case, these creators are university students.</p>

            <h3>Open to all students</h3>
            <p>PennApps is open to all current undergraduate and graduate students. You don't have to attend Penn and you don't have to be a computer science major. Just bring a laptop and you're good to go.</p>

            <p>Turn any surface into a touch input surface. Utilizing only a microphone, we can transform objects like walls and tables into a touchpad. It's like a touchscreen but without the screen!

            ScratchTable is a demo of this technology in the form of a virtual turntable.</p>

            <p>We know that the most effective way to make anything happen is by reaching out to your elected officials, and we also know that this can be a lot of work.
